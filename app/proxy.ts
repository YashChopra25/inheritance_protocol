/**
 * Per-request Content-Security-Policy with a nonce.
 *
 * Why this is not just a static header in `next.config.ts`: Next.js bootstraps
 * the App Router with **inline** scripts (`self.__next_r`, the flight-data
 * `self.__next_f.push(...)` chunks). A static `script-src 'self'` blocks them,
 * the bootstrap never runs, hydration never starts, and every client page hangs
 * on its loading state forever. The only two ways out are `'unsafe-inline'` —
 * which gives up most of what a CSP is for on a page that signs transactions —
 * or a per-request nonce, which is what this does.
 *
 * Next.js reads the nonce straight out of the CSP header we set here and
 * applies it to the framework scripts, the page bundles and its own inline
 * script and style tags automatically. Nothing in the app has to thread it
 * through manually.
 *
 * NOTE: nonces require dynamic rendering — a statically prerendered page is
 * built before any request exists, so it carries no nonce and its inline
 * scripts would be blocked. `app/layout.tsx` therefore sets
 * `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"`. For this app that costs almost
 * nothing: every dashboard route is wallet-driven and renders a loading state
 * until the client hydrates anyway.
