/**
 * Lets an heir publish the encryption key their inherited documents are sealed
 * to (C5).
 *
 * This is a prerequisite, not a nicety: the owner seals each document to the
 * recipients that exist *at upload time*, so an heir who registers late cannot
 * open anything uploaded before they did. The card therefore states that
 * plainly rather than presenting registration as optional.
 *
 * The secret half is derived from a wallet signature and never leaves the
 * browser — the server, the pinning service and the chain only ever see the
 * public half.
