 * Security headers (fixes H6).
 *
 * This origin asks people to sign Solana transactions, which makes it a prime
 * clickjacking and script-injection target — and the config was previously the
 * untouched scaffold, so none of these were set.
 *
 * The Content-Security-Policy is deliberately NOT here: it needs a fresh nonce
 * per request so that Next.js's own inline bootstrap scripts can run, and a
 * static header cannot carry one. A static `script-src 'self'` blocked those
 * scripts outright, which stopped hydration and left every client page spinning
 * forever. See `proxy.ts` for the real policy.
