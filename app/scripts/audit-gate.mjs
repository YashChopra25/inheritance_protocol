/**
 * Dependency audit gate (H7).
 *
 * `npm audit --audit-level=high` is the obvious gate, but it is the wrong one
 * here: this tree carries a handful of high-severity advisories that have no
 * fixed version upstream AND cannot be reached by this application. A gate that
 * is permanently red gets ignored, which is worse than no gate — so instead,
 * each unreachable advisory is listed below with an explicit justification and
 * a review date, and ANYTHING ELSE at high or critical fails the build.
 *
 * Rules for editing ACCEPTED:
 *   * Only for advisories with no upstream fix that provably cannot execute in
 *     this app. "It's only a dev tool" is not enough — say why it never runs.
 *   * Always set `review`. An expired entry fails the build on purpose, so
 *     these are re-examined rather than accumulating forever.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/audit-gate.mjs
